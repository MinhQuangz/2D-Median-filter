# 2D-Median-filter
This project that I do for my old university friend from Australia. The algorithm that I watch on youtube. Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJx3g-ZEfm4 
After watching the algorithm on yotube, the first thing that I do was add the csv file into the code, after that I had border the matrix by 0, and then using matrix 3x3
into the new matrix, then I add 9 elements into one aray and then choose the middle element. That element is the value we will change to each position and after all
,I export the csv file. Then I compare with the clean csv file, it is same.
