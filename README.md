# 2D-Median-filter
This project that I do for my old university friend from Australia. The algorithm that I watch on youtube. Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJx3g-ZEfm4 
After watching the algorithm on yotube, the first thing was found out how to add the csv file into the code, after that I had border the matrix by 0, and then using matrix 3x3into the new matrix, then I add 9 elements into one aray and then choose the middle element. That element is the value we will change to each position and after all, I export the csv file. Then I compare with the clean csv file, it is same. 
The file main.c will run the code, in this file, will have include the the medianfilter.h, which link to the function in the file medianfilter.c. Therefore, 3 files have to be in the same folder.
